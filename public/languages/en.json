            "Q3-A-4": "If the status light is still red after reloading the page, then there is probably something wrong with the machine learning model. Try going to the \"Learn &amp; Test\" page for the project, which is where any error messages about your model can be found.",

            "Q4": "Why are machine learning models automatically deleted?",
            "Q4-A-1": "This was a feature requested by schools when Machine Learning for Kids was first developed. It came from the fact that there is a limit for how many machine learning models a class can have at any given time, and a need to make it easy to manage this limit.",
            "Q4-A-2": "Rather than requiring kids to have to clean up after a lesson and delete their models (in order to allow the next class to be able to create models), the tool can automatically clean up by deleting the models after the lesson is over. This makes it easy to run the next lesson, and the next lesson after that, without manual clean-ups in between.",
            "Q4-A-3": "The time limit before models are deleted is configurable. In a school, where lessons are 1 or 2 hours long, deleting models after two hours might be sensible. For a weekly coding club, six days might be a better fit to make sure that models are cleared up before each new club session.",

            "Q1-A-2": "However, creating an account does enable additional features. Students can save their work and come back to it in a later lesson. They can work on a project together with other students in their class. They can log on from home and show their family what they've made.",
