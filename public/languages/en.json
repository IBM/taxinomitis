We all use machine learning systems every day - such as spam filters, recommendation engines, language translation services, chatbots and digital assistants, search engines, and fraud detection systems.<br/><br/>It will soon be normal for machine learning systems to drive our cars, and help doctors to diagnose and treat our illnesses.<br/><br/>It's important that kids are aware of how our world works. The best way to understand the capabilities and implications is to be able to build with this technology for themselves.<br/><br/>To learn more, read: <a target='_blank' class='btn btn-primary' href='http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3513'>'Introducing Machine Learning to kids'</a>"

            "Q2-A-1": "If you're using Safari on macOS and the Scratch menus \"File -&gt; Load Project\" and \"File -&gt; Save Project\" menus aren't working, it might be that you're running in Safe Mode.",

            "Q3-A-3": "If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is red, that normally means something is wrong. It might be a temporary problem. Try saving your project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Save Project'), then refresh the browser page. If the status light goes green after the page reloads, you can load your project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Load Project') to pick up where you left off.",
            "Q3-A-4": "If the status light is still red after reloading the page, then there is probably something wrong with the machine learning model. Try going to the \"Learn &amp; Test\" page for the project, which is where any error messages about your model can be found.",
            "Q3-A-5": "If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is green, then the blocks should be working. If you're not getting the responses you expect from them, try going to the \"Learn &amp; Test\" page and checking what results your model returns.",

            "Q4-A-2": "<a href='https://scratch.mit.edu/preview-faq'>Scratch 3 is under development</a>, and will remove the need for Adobe Flash. Once this is released, I hope that this will allow projects to be worked on from tablets like iPads. I'm not sure when this will be, though."
