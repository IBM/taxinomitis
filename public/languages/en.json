We all use machine learning systems every day - such as spam filters, recommendation engines, language translation services, chatbots and digital assistants, search engines, and fraud detection systems.<br/><br/>It will soon be normal for machine learning systems to drive our cars, and help doctors to diagnose and treat our illnesses. <br/><br/>It's important that kids are aware of how our world works. The best way to understand the capabilities and implications is to be able to build with this technology for themselves. <br/><br/>To learn more, read: <a target='_blank' class='btn btn-primary' href='http://dalelane.co.uk/blog/?p=3513'>'Introducing Machine Learning to kids'</a>"

            "Q4": "Why are machine learning models automatically deleted?",
            "Q4-A-1": "This was a feature requested by schools when Machine Learning for Kids was first developed. It came from the fact that there is a limit for how many machine learning models a class can have at any given time, and a need to make it easy to manage this limit.",
            "Q4-A-2": "Rather than requiring kids to have to clean up after a lesson and delete their models (in order to allow the next class to be able to create models), the tool can automatically clean up by deleting the models after the lesson is over. This makes it easy to run the next lesson, and the next lesson after that, without manual clean-ups in between.",
            "Q4-A-3": "The time limit before models are deleted is configurable. In a school, where lessons are 1 or 2 hours long, deleting models after two hours might be sensible.
