            "Q4-A-1": "This was a feature requested by schools when Machine Learning for Kids was first developed. It came from the fact that there is a limit for how many machine learning models a class can have at any given time, and a need to make it easy to manage this limit.",
            "Q4-A-2": "Rather than requiring kids to have to clean up after a lesson and delete their models (in order to allow the next class to be able to create models), the tool can automatically clean up by deleting the models after the lesson is over. This makes it easy to run the next lesson, and the next lesson after that, without manual clean-ups in between.",
