                    <p>
                    The Teacher's page shows the number of machine learning models available to your class. (This page is only accessible to
                    teachers or group leaders). This value is calculated by taking the number of API keys / credentials that the teacher has
                    created, and multiplying it by the number of machine learning models that can be created with a single API key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Unfortunately, this can be misleading. The value is based on assumptions about which Pricing Plan were used when creating
                    API keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For <span class="mlprojecttype">text</span> projects, the assumption is that "Standard Plan" will be used for creating
                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation">Watson Assistant</a> (formerly Watson Conversation) credentials, as this supports
                    20 "workspaces". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Assistant credentials by 20 when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their text projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Lite Plan" supports only 5 "workspaces", so if any of the Watson Assistant credentials were created in the Lite
                    pricing plan, then this means the actual limit will be less than displayed on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For <span class="mlprojecttype">images</span> projects, the assumption is that "Lite Plan" will be used for creating
                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/watson_vision_combined">Watson Visual Recognition</a> API keys,
                    as this supports 1 "custom model". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Visual Recognition API keys by 1
                    when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their images projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Standard Plan" doesn't have a limit on the number of custom models, so if any of the Watson Visual Recognition
                    API keys were created with the Standard pricing plan, this means there isn't actually a limit on the number of machine
                    learning models for images projects, despite what is shown on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sorry for any confusion that this page causes. I will be updating the Teacher's admin page so it asks for the Pricing Plan
                    for each set of credentials or API keys, so that I can do the appropriate multiplication in the UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the meantime, the correct limit is whatever is shown on IBM Cloud where the credentials are created. More detailed
                    information about all of this can be found in this

                    <p>
                    Occassionally, the list of students that Auth0 returns can get a little out of date, and fail to reflect students that have recently
                    been created (or similarly, still show students that have been recently deleted).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In these instances, the students have normally been successfully created (or deleted) and it is just that the list of students being
                    displayed doesn't reflect recent updates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Auth0 will normally report such incidents on their status page as
                    <a href="https://status.auth0.com/incidents/0sk1d3hjlw0m">user indexing delays</a>
                    or
                    <a href="https://status.auth0.com/incidents/t8995b9jggx5">problems with their Search API</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The best thing to do in these cases is to wait for the Auth0 indexing to catch up.

                    <p>
                    This was a feature requested by schools when Machine Learning for Kids was first developed. It came from the fact that
                    there is a limit for how many machine learning models a class can have at any given time, and a need to make it easy
                    to manage this limit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Rather than requiring kids to have to clean up after a lesson and delete their models (in order to allow the next class
                    to be able to create models), the tool can automatically clean up by deleting the models after the lesson is over. This
                    makes it easy to run the next lesson, and the next lesson after that, without manual clean-ups in between.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The time limit before models are deleted is configurable. In a school, where lessons are 1 or 2 hours long, deleting
                    models after two hours might be sensible. For a weekly coding club, six days might be a better fit to make sure that
                    models are cleared up before each new club session.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <em>Note: Only machine learning models are automatically deleted, not the training data that was used to create
                    them. So if a model is automatically deleted for a project that a student is still working on, they can always just
                    click the "Train" button again to create the model again.</em>

                    Using "Try it now" to means there is no need to log on or create an account. There are no passwords for students to have to remember, and no need for teachers to have to provide personal information. It also saves teachers the time needed to manage student accounts.

                    <p>
                    However, creating an account does enable additional features. Students can save their work and come back to it in a later lesson. They can work on a project together with other students in their class. They can log on from home and show their family what they've made.
