                    Machine Learning for Kids uses Scratch 2. Scratch needs Adobe Flash to work, so you need to be using an operating system
                    and a web browser that can work with Flash (so that means no iPads for now, sorry).

                    Occassionally, the Scratch blocks for your machine learning model can lose the connection to the server. When this happens, they will stop returning results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    You can check whether this has happened using the coloured status light in the "More Blocks" palette.

                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is red, that normally means something is wrong. It might be a temporary problem. Try saving
                    your project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Save Project'), then refresh the browser page. If the status light goes green after the page reloads, you can load your
                    project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Load Project') to pick up where you left off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If the status light is still red after reloading the page, then there is probably something wrong with the machine learning model. Try going to the
                    "Learn &amp; Test" page for the project, which is where any error messages about your model can be found.

                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is green, then the blocks should be working. If you're not getting the responses you expect
                    from them, try going to the "Learn &amp; Test" page and checking what results your model returns.

                    The page should check on the status of the machine learning model every 30 seconds, but very
                    occassionally it stops checking, so you might be waiting for the model when it is actually

                    The Teacher's page shows the number of machine learning models available to your class. (This page is only accessible to
                    teachers or group leaders). This value is calculated by taking the number of API keys / credentials that the teacher has
                    created, and multiplying it by the number of machine learning models that can be created with a single API key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Unfortunately, this can be misleading. The value is based on assumptions about which Pricing Plan were used when creating
                    API keys.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For <span class="mlprojecttype">text</span> projects, the assumption is that "Standard Plan" will be used for creating
                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation">Watson Assistant</a> (formerly Watson Conversation) credentials, as this supports
                    20 "workspaces". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Assistant credentials by 20 when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their text projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Lite Plan" supports only 5 "workspaces", so if any of the Watson Assistant credentials were created in the Lite
                    pricing plan, then this means the actual limit will be less than displayed on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For <span class="mlprojecttype">images</span> projects, the assumption is that "Lite Plan" will be used for creating
                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/watson_vision_combined">Watson Visual Recognition</a> API keys,
                    as this supports 1 "custom model". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Visual Recognition API keys by 1
                    when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their images projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Standard Plan" doesn't have a limit on the number of custom models, so if any of the Watson Visual Recognition
                    API keys were created with the Standard pricing plan, this means there isn't actually a limit on the number of machine
                    learning models for images projects, despite what is shown on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sorry for any confusion that this page causes. I will be updating the Teacher's admin page so it asks for the Pricing Plan
                    for each set of credentials or API keys, so that I can do the appropriate multiplication in the UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the meantime, the correct limit is whatever is shown on IBM Cloud where the credentials are created. More detailed
                    information about all of this can be found in this

                    <p>
                    Occassionally, the list of students that Auth0 returns can get a little out of date, and fail to reflect students that have recently
                    been created (or similarly, still show students that have been recently deleted).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In these instances, the students have normally been successfully created (or deleted) and it is just that the list of students being

                    <p>
                    Auth0 will normally report such incidents on their status page as

                    This was a feature requested by schools when Machine Learning for Kids was first developed. It came from the fact that
                    there is a limit for how many machine learning models a class can have at any given time, and a need to make it easy
                    to manage this limit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Rather than requiring kids to have to clean up after a lesson and delete their models (in order to allow the next class
                    to be able to create models), the tool can automatically clean up by deleting the models after the lesson is over. This
                    makes it easy to run the next lesson, and the next lesson after that, without manual clean-ups in between.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The time limit before models are deleted is configurable. In a school, where lessons are 1 or 2 hours long, deleting
                    models after two hours might be sensible. For a weekly coding club, six days might be a better fit to make sure that
                    models are cleared up before each new club session.
                    </p>

                    them. So if a model is automatically deleted for a project that a student is still working on, they can always just
                    click the "Train" button again to create the model again.</em>

                    Using "Try it now" to means there is no need to log on or create an account. There are no passwords for students to have to remember, and no need for teachers to have to provide personal information. It also saves teachers the time needed to manage student accounts.

                    However, creating an account does enable additional features. Students can save their work and come back to it in a later lesson. They can work on a project together with other students in their class. They can log on from home and show their family what they've made.

                    A teacher can delete a student account at any time by visiting the "Teacher" page  and clicking the "Delete student account" button next to the student account you want to delete.

                    This will delete all information stored about that student and all of their projects and machine learning models.

                    I also <a href="https://github.com/IBM/taxinomitis-docs/raw/master/docs/pdf/machinelearningforkids-schools.pdf">recommend that students are given generic
                    usernames</a> (e.g. "student1") so that students are not identifiable outside of their school or coding group.

                    User management for Machine Learning for Kids is implemented using the third party service, <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>. They store
                    the IP address that you last logged into Machine Learning for Kids from, and the type of browser you used. I've never found a reason to use that,
                    but it is stored if I did want to go and look for it.

                    <p>
                    Errors that happen in the web browser are captured using the third party service, <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>. If something
                    goes wrong, it will capture information about the error, including your username, IP address, type of browser you were using, and a technical
                    description of what went wrong.

                    I use <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> so that I know how many users visit Machine Learning for Kids each day.
                    Although it captures information such as geographic location and browser type, this is only ever displayed to me in an anonymised aggregate way.
