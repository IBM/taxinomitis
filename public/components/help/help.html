                    Machine Learning for Kids uses Scratch 2. Scratch needs Adobe Flash to work, so you need to be using an operating system
                    and a web browser that can work with Flash (so that means no iPads for now, sorry).
                    </p>

                    Occassionally, the Scratch blocks for your machine learning model can lose the connection to the server. When this happens, they will stop returning results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    You can check whether this has happened using the coloured status light in the "More Blocks" palette.

                    <p>
                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is red, that normally means something is wrong. It might be a temporary problem. Try saving
                    your project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Save Project'), then refresh the browser page. If the status light goes green after the page reloads, you can load your
                    project (using 'File' -&gt; 'Load Project') to pick up where you left off.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    If the status light is still red after reloading the page, then there is probably something wrong with the machine learning model. Try going to the
                    "Learn &amp; Test" page for the project, which is where any error messages about your model can be found.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If the status light next to your machine learning Scratch blocks is green, then the blocks should be working. If you're not getting the responses you expect
                    from them, try going to the "Learn &amp; Test" page and checking what results your model returns.

                    <p>
                    For <span class="mlprojecttype">text</span> projects, the assumption is that "Standard Plan" will be used for creating
                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation">Watson Assistant</a> (formerly Watson Conversation) credentials, as this supports
                    20 "workspaces". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Assistant credentials by 20 when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their text projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Lite Plan" supports only 5 "workspaces", so if any of the Watson Assistant credentials were created in the Lite
                    pricing plan, then this means the actual limit will be less than displayed on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    For <span class="mlprojecttype">images</span> projects, the assumption is that "Lite Plan" will be used for creating
                    <a href="https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/watson_vision_combined">Watson Visual Recognition</a> API keys,
                    as this supports 1 "custom model". The teacher's page multiplies the number of Watson Visual Recognition API keys by 1
                    when displaying
                    <blockquote>"Your class is allowed to have up to ?? machine learning models in total across all their images projects."</blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The "Standard Plan" doesn't have a limit on the number of custom models, so if any of the Watson Visual Recognition
                    API keys were created with the Standard pricing plan, this means there isn't actually a limit on the number of machine
                    learning models for images projects, despite what is shown on the Teacher's page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sorry for any confusion that this page causes. I will be updating the Teacher's admin page so it asks for the Pricing Plan
                    for each set of credentials or API keys, so that I can do the appropriate multiplication in the UI.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the meantime, the correct limit is whatever is shown on IBM Cloud where the credentials are created. More detailed
                    information about all of this can be found in this

                    Occassionally, the list of students that Auth0 returns can get a little out of date, and fail to reflect students that have recently
                    been created (or similarly, still show students that have been recently deleted).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In these instances, the students have normally been successfully created (or deleted) and it is just that the list of students being

                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Auth0 will normally report such incidents on their status page as

                    <p>
                    The best thing to do in these cases is to wait for the Auth0 indexing to catch up.

                    create a Watson Assistant service in the Sydney region, you'll get an API key instead of a username and password.

                    I'm working on adding support for API keys, but in the meantime you'll need to create Watson Assistant in any of the

                    Using "Try it now" to means there is no need to log on or create an account. There are no passwords for students to have to remember, and no need for teachers to have to provide personal information. It also saves teachers the time needed to manage student accounts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    However, creating an account does enable additional features. Students can save their work and come back to it in a later lesson. They can work on a project together with other students in their class. They can log on from home and show their family what they've made.

                    User management for Machine Learning for Kids is implemented using the third party service, <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a>. They store
                    the IP address that you last logged into Machine Learning for Kids from, and the type of browser you used. I've never found a reason to use that,
                    but it is stored if I did want to go and look for it.

                    Errors that happen in the web browser are captured using the third party service, <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>. If something
                    goes wrong, it will capture information about the error, including your username, IP address, type of browser you were using, and a technical
                    description of what went wrong.

                    I use <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> so that I know how many users visit Machine Learning for Kids each day.
                    Although it captures information such as geographic location and browser type, this is only ever displayed to me in an anonymised aggregate way.
