            This block lets you start a microphone listening for sounds that a machine learning model can recognize.
            However, when you tried to use it, it didn't work because <strong>you don't seem to have a machine learning model</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="help-section">
            The most likely reason is that you haven't trained a machine learning model. With sound projects, you need to train a
            model every time you open the Scratch page.
        </div>
        <div class="help-section">
            Or it could be that you started a model training, but didn't wait long enough for it to finish training.
        </div>
        <div class="help-section">
            One way to avoid both of these problems is to include training a model in your Scratch project, like this:
