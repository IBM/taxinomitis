<p><em>This is an automated email from Machine Learning for Kids.</em></p>

<p>You're receiving this email because you created a class account with Machine Learning for Kids.</p>

<p>There was a failure during a regular check of the Watson credentials that you provided for use by Machine Learning for Kids.</p>

<p>The error returned by IBM Cloud was:<br/>
<code>{{{ errormessage }}}</code></p>

<p>The username being checked was:<br/>
<code>{{{ userid }}}</code> ({{{ servicename }}})</p>


<p><strong><u>How could this happen?</u></strong></p>

<p>The mostly likely reason is that since adding the credentials to Machine Learning for Kids, you've deleted the credentials from IBM Cloud (or deleted your IBM Cloud account entirely).</p>


<p><strong><u>Why am I telling you?</u></strong></p>

<p>I'm letting you know to avoid the chance of you running a class and only finding out that the credentials in your account aren't working when your students fail to train any machine learning models.</p>

<p>To avoid spamming you, you won't be notified about these credentials again.</p>

<br/>

<p><strong><u>What should you do?</u></strong></p>

<p>If you have deleted the credentials from IBM Cloud, please go back to <a href="https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/teacher">machinelearningforkids.co.uk/teacher</a> and remove the credentials from your list.</p>

<p>If that's not the case, please let me know.</p>

<br/>

<p>Kind regards</p>
