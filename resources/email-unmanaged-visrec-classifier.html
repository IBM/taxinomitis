<p><em>This is an automated email from Machine Learning for Kids.</em></p>

<p>You're receiving this email because you created a class account with Machine Learning for Kids.</p>

<p>A regular check of the Watson Visual Recognition credentials that you provided for use by Machine Learning for Kids found a machine learning model (what Visual Recognition calls a "custom classifier") that isn't known to Machine Learning for Kids.</p>

<p>The classifier name is: <code>{{{ classifier }}}</code></p>

<p><strong><u>How could this happen?</u></strong></p>

<p><strong>Reason 1)</strong><br/>
You're using your Watson Visual Recognition credentials for other things as well as Machine Learning for Kids, and you intentionally created another classifier for another reason.<br/>
That's fine! Just ignore this email. <br/>
But be aware that they count towards the limits that IBM Cloud enforces for your credentials, so that will mean one fewer model that can be created by your students.</p>

<p><strong>Reason 2)</strong><br/>
Something went wrong when the workspace was being deleted and it was left behind accidentally.<br/>
It should be deleted as it counts towards the limits that IBM Cloud enforces for your credentials, and so will mean one fewer model that your students can create.<br/>
You can do that from <a href="https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/teacher/projects">machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/teacher/projects</a> </p>


<br/>

<p>You won't be notified about this classifier again.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
