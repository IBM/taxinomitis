This is an automated email from Machine Learning for Kids.

You're receiving this email because you created a class account with Machine Learning for Kids.

A regular check of the Watson Visual Recognition credentials that you provided for use by Machine Learning for Kids found a machine learning model (what Visual Recognition calls a "custom classifier") that isn't known to Machine Learning for Kids.

The classifier ID is:  CLASSIFIERID

How could this happen?

Reason 1)
You're using your Watson Visual Recognition credentials for other things as well as Machine Learning for Kids, and you intentionally created another classifier for another reason.
That's fine! Just ignore this email.
But be aware that they count towards the limits that IBM Cloud enforces for your API key, so that will mean one fewer model that can be created by your students.

Reason 2)
Something went wrong when the classifier was being deleted and it was left behind accidentally.
It should be deleted as it counts towards the limits that IBM Cloud enforces for your credentials, and so will mean one fewer model that your students can create.
You can do that from https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/teacher/projects
Or, please just send an email to dale.lane@uk.ibm.com and I'd be happy to do it for you.

You won't be notified about this classifier again.

Kind regards

Dale
