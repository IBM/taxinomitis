This is an automated email from Machine Learning for Kids.

You're receiving this email because your class encountered a large number of errors from IBM Watson credentials.

What errors were there?
=======================

Students in your class tried to train machine learning models, but this failed with errors like:

> Your class already has created their maximum allowed number of models.
>
> Please let your teacher or group leader know that their
> "Watson Assistant API keys have no more workspaces available"

They continued trying to train machine learning models despite these errors, until these repeated efforts started to result in with errors like:

> Your class is making too many requests to create machine learning models at too fast a rate.
> Please stop now and let your teacher or group leader know that
> "the Watson Assistant service is currently rate limiting their API key"

This will have even started to impact usage of the machine learning models that were previously successfully trained.


Why did this happen?
====================

When your students click the "Train new machine learning model" button, this uses the IBM Watson service keys that you provided when you set up the class.

(You can review these at https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/teacher/apikeys)

Each of the service keys that you provide come with usage limits. These vary based on the Plan for the service instances that you create (i.e. a "Standard" tier Watson API key lets your class train more machine learning models than a "Free" or "Lite" tier Watson API key).

These are displayed in the IBM Cloud UI where the credentials were created (where Watson Assistant calls them "workspaces", and Visual Recognition calls them "custom models").

These are described in more detail in the document here:
https://github.com/IBM/taxinomitis-docs/raw/master/docs/pdf/machinelearningforkids-apikeys.pdf

To be clear, these limits are applied and enforced by the IBM Watson APIs - *not* by Machine Learning for Kids.


What can you do?
================

You need enough Watson API keys to support the number of students in your class, and the number of projects that they have.

The errors your class encountered today suggests that you don't have enough service instances for your students.

Things that you could try:

* Create additional IBM Watson API key(s) and add them to your class account. There are no limits for the number of API keys you can have in a class.
Add them to https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/teacher/apikeys

* Use a different Plan for the API keys you create. Lite plan API keys for Watson Assistant allow your class to create 5 machine learning models. If you have more than five students, that won't be enough. You could try using the Standard plan, which allows 20 machine learning models.

* Advise your students that when they see errors saying that they can't train a machine learning model, that repeatedly clicking the button will not improve that, and will in fact make things worse for their classmates

* Use "whole class projects" - where all (or groups) of your students work together on a shared project. If 10 of your students train a machine learning model between them, instead of training a machine learning model each, then you won't need as many API keys.

If you have any questions or concerns about this, or think this will prevent you from running the classes you want to run, please get in touch - I will help in any way I can.


Kind regards
