            "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that Washington hoped to receive more help from Russian President Vladimir Putin in efforts to convince North Korea to abandon its missile and nuclear weapons program. The primary point was to talk about North Korea, because we would love to have his help on North Korea. China's helping, Russia's not helping; we d like to have Russia's help, Trump told reporters. Trump spoke with Putin by phone on Thursday.",
            "China has punished 8,123 people for committing fiscal violations after an audit of how the government's 2016 central budget was spent revealed multiple problems, the Xinhua state news agency reported. Hu Zejun, head of the National Audit Office, announced the infringements while briefing lawmakers on Saturday, Xinhua said. A broad anti-graft campaign in China, aimed at rooting out deep-seated corruption in the ruling Communist Party, including the misuse or embezzlement of government funds, has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials. Hu said that of the offenders, 970 were punished for misusing funds earmarked for a poverty relief campaign intended to lift everyone in rural areas out of poverty by 2020. Another 1,363 were punished for irregularities in the use of funds meant to provide affordable housing, she said. She said 800 people in state-owned enterprises and 73 people in eight major banks were found to have committed violations, along with 505 people who",
            "The jailed leader of Catalonia's main pro-independence party has backed away from demands for unilateral secession from Spain, days before a regional election that polls suggest will produce a hung parliament. The independence drive has tipped Spain into its worst political crisis since the return of democracy in the 1970s, dividing opinion in the region, denting an economic rebound and prompting a business exodus to other parts of the country. In reply to written questions from Reuters passed to him in prison where he is being held on allegations of rebellion and sedition, Oriol Junqueras struck a conciliatory tone. He wrote that he would continue to pursue independence if he became Catalonia's next president, but also build bridges and shake hands with representatives of the Spanish state. I can assure you that we are democrats before we are separatists and that the aim (of gaining independence) does not always justify the means, he said in comments",
            "A Seoul court on Friday found Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin guilty of breach of trust and embezzlement and sentenced him to 20 months in prison, suspended for two years, leaving him free to try and revive the conglomerate after steep losses in China. The Seoul Central District Court cleared the executive of some counts of breach of trust and one embezzlement charge. I apologize to the public, Shin said as he left court, without commenting further. Prosecutors had sought a ten-year jail term for Shin on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust after a probe since 2016 into the retail-to-chemicals group. The ruling will come as a relief to Lotte at the end of a tough year during which it became the highest-profile corporate victim of a Beijing-Seoul spat over South Korea's installation of a U.S. missile defense system. South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate said, We respect the court's decision. Lotte Group executives and employees will further unit",
            "The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than Dec. 31, 2020, according to the European Commission's negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday. The transitional arrangements should apply as from the date of entry into force of the Withdrawal Agreement and should not last beyond 31 December 2020, the published text showed. Coinciding with the end of the EU's current seven-year budget period, the end of 2020, 21 months after Brexit at the end of March 2019, had long been expected as the target end date of the transition but this was the first official confirmation that this is the official goal of the Union negotiators. British Prime Minister Theresa May had formally asked for a transition to last around two years. The four pages of new directives for EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier were in line with guidelines issued by EU leaders at a summit on Friday and will form the basis of talks on the transition which Barnier hopes to s",
            "The leaders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan pledged on Monday to improve relations, after ties between the two former Soviet republics degenerated into a trade war under the previous Kyrgyz leadership. The standoff between Astana and the government of former Kyrgyz president Almazbek Atambayev strained a Russian-led economic bloc and disrupted supplies of Kyrgyz goods to some European countries. We have established a constructive and trust-based dialogue in all areas, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's office quoted him as telling his Kyrgyz counterpart Sooronbai Jeenbekov. Jeenbekov was elected president last month. In the run-up the vote, his predecessor and backer Atambayev accused the Kazakh government of interfering in Kyrgyz politics and supporting an opposition candidate. Astana denied those charges but introduced tough border controls that nearly halted the flow of goods out of Kyrgyzstan, which is landlocked and sends most of its exports out through Kaz",

Paolo Duterte announced his resignation during a special session of the Davao City Council. Davao is President Duterte's hometown and its mayor is Paolo's younger sister, Sara Duterte-Carpio. There are recent unfortunate events in my life that are closely tied to my failed first marriage, the vice mayor said, in a statement made available to media. These, among others, include the maligning of my reputation in the recent name dropping incident in the Bureau of Customs smuggling case and the very public squabble with my daughter. Paolo testified at a senate investigation in September into a seized shipment of around $125 million worth of narcotics from China after opponents of the president, who has instigated a fierce cra",
            "Moldova recalled its ambassador to Russia for consultations in response to the harassment and intimidation by Russian authorities of Moldovan politicians and officials, the Moldovan foreign ministry said on Monday. Moldova and Russia have been embroiled in a series of rows this year, including tit-for-tat expulsions of each other's diplomats in May and Moldova declaring the Russian deputy prime minister persona non grata in August. The Chisinau government says its officials are being mistreated partly to derail a Moldovan investigation into an alleged Russian-led money laundering operation. Russia has accused Moldova of some openly anti-Russian actions . In announcing the ambassador's recall, the Moldovan Foreign Ministry said in a statement on its website: We will look for ways to overcome the current situation so that in the future such actions are avoided, which can spoil Moldovan-Russian relations, which the Moldovan side wants to be friendly, trusting",
            "Eight women and two children from the same Yemeni family were killed when an air strike by forces of the Saudi-led coalition involved in the country's three-year-old war hit a wedding party, residents said on Monday. The 10 people were returning on Sunday evening from a wedding in Marib province, an area east of the capital Sanaa held by the Iran-allied Houthi group, when their vehicle was struck, the sources said. A spokesman for the coalition, which denies targeting civilians and says that every report of an attack is investigated, did not respond to an email requesting comment. The residents said the victims, all female, were part of the same family, but gave no further details on their ages or if anyone else was traveling with them. The coalition has been conducting regular air strikes in Houthi-held areas as part of a campaign to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power. The United Nations says that more than 60,000 people have been killed or wounded i",
            "Egypt's Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry will visit Addis Ababa next week for talks with his Ethiopian counterpart, a foreign ministry spokesman said, in a bid to end a standoff over a multi-billion dollar dam project on the Nile river. The dispute, which also involves Sudan, centers on control of a share of the waters of the Nile that stretches 6,695 km (4,184 miles) from Lake Victoria to the Mediterranean and is the economic lifeblood of all three countries. Cairo says the dam would threaten water supplies that have fed Egypt's agriculture and economy for thousands of years. Ethiopia says the Grand Renaissance Dam, which it hopes will help make it Africa's largest power exporter, will have no major effect on Egypt. It accuses Cairo of flexing its political muscle to deter financiers from backing other Ethiopian power projects. Delegations from Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia met in Cairo in November to approve a study by a French firm commissioned to assess the dam's envir",
            "An aardvark was killed and four meerkats are missing believed dead after a blaze tore through part of London Zoo early on Saturday, destroying a cafe and gift shop. The fire broke out shortly after 0600 GMT at the zoo's Animal Adventure section before spreading to the shop and cafe, near to an area where visitors can handle and feed animals, the zoo and London Fire Brigade said. More than 70 firefighters took three hours to bring the fire under control while desperate keepers who live on the site in Regent's Park in central London moved animals to safety. Some of the staff needed treatment for smoke inhalation and shock. Ten-year-old Misha the aardvark, one of the zoo's best-loved animals, perished in the fire and four of the meerkats were unaccounted for and are also presumed to have died. Taking their name from the Afrikaans word for earth-pig , aardvarks are large burrowing mammals found across much of Africa. We re absolutely devastated that Misha the aardvark",
            "A former Korean Air Lines executive who went into a rage on an aircraft over the way she was served nuts in first class avoided jail on Thursday when South Korea's Supreme Court upheld her 10-month suspended sentence. Heather Cho had been charged with, among others, violation of aviation law in 2015 after she took issue with the way she was served nuts and forced the Korean Air Lines plane to return to its gate in a New York airport in December 2014. The incident became a national scandal in South Korea, as Cho is the daughter of the chairman of Hanjin Group, the conglomerate of which Korean Air is an affiliate. Cho stepped down from her role as Korean Air Lines vice president and attempted to apologize to crew members. The Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling that said forcing an on-the-ground plane to return to its gate cannot be seen as route deviation, but found Cho guilty of abusive language and actions against cabin crew and forcing a crew member to",
            "Russia should scrap the 13 percent profit tax on funds repatriated from abroad and renew an amnesty from penalties for businesses returning capital, as Washington moves toward tougher sanctions, President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. Amid huge capital outflows in 2014, deteriorating relations with the West over the Ukraine conflict and weak oil prices, Moscow offered the amnesty for those returning capital to Russia. The amnesty, which expired in mid-2016, scrapped responsibility for past taxes and currency violations for those who declared assets abroad. But few agreed to take part in the amnesty. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Friday that his ministry was proposing such an amnesty be restored in 2018 for at least a year. Speaking at the meeting with the leadership of the Russian parliament, Putin said he had two proposals which he had not previously spoken about publicly. The first is to extend the amnesty timeline, I mean external restriction",
            "The Israeli military said it attacked a Hamas training compound in Gaza on Monday in response to rocket strikes from the Palestinian enclave, which have surged since U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital on Dec 6. Neither side reported any casualties in the overnight shelling exchange, which occurred days before U.S. Vice President Mike Pence visits Israel and neighboring Egypt, which also borders Gaza and is involved in its internal politics. Militants in Gaza, territory controlled by the Hamas Islamist group, have launched more than a dozen rockets into southern Israel over the last two weeks, the most intensive attacks since a seven-week-long Gaza war in 2014. Two rockets were fired late on Sunday, one of them exploding inside an Israeli border community and the other hitting an open area, the military said. Another rocket launched early on Monday fell short inside Gaza, it said. Three structures in a Hamas training camp were hit",
            "The United States has given China a draft resolution for tougher U.N. sanctions on North Korea and is hoping for a quick vote on it by the U.N. Security Council, a Western diplomat said on Tuesday. A senior official of the Trump administration confirmed efforts were under way to negotiate a new U.N. resolution, but added that there had been no agreement. We re trying to get another one, said the official, who did not want to be identified. They re not there yet. Details of the draft given to China last week were not immediately available, but the United States is keen to step up global sanctions to pressure North Korea to give up a weapons program aimed developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. Among the steps it wants is a tightening of restrictions on North Korea's supply of refined petroleum, which is capped by previous U.N. sanctions at 2 million barrels a year.

            "Pope Francis used his Christmas message on Monday to call for a negotiated two-state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, after U.S. President Donald Trump stoked regional tensions with his recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Francis spoke of the Middle East conflict and other world flashpoints in his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) address, four days after more than 120 countries backed a U.N. resolution urging the United States to reverse its decision on Jerusalem. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached, one that would allow the peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders, he said, referring to the Israelis and Palestinians. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, he said in his address",

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson earlier told a meeting of the U.N Security Council on Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs that a sustained cessation of North Korea's threatening behavior was needed before talks could occur between Washington and Pyongyang. North Korea's U.N. ambassador, Ja Song Nam, made no mention of Tillerson's call in his speech to the session, which he called a desperate measure plotted by the U.S. being terrified by the incredible might of our Republic that has successfully achieved the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.",
            "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that vote in favor of a draft United Nations resolution calling for the United States to withdraw its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we re watching those votes. Let them vote against us. We ll save a lot. We don t care, Trump told reporters at the White House. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday - at the request of Arab and Muslim countries - to vote on a draft resolution, which the United States vetoed on Monday in the 15-member U.N.

            "Syrian rebel groups on Monday rejected Russia's planned Sochi conference on Syria, saying Moscow was seeking to bypass a U.N.-based Geneva peace process and blaming Russia for committing war crimes in the war-torn country. In a statement by around 40 rebel groups who include some of the military factions who participated in earlier rounds of Geneva peace talks, they said Moscow had not put pressure on the Syrian government to reach a political settlement. Russia has not contributed one step to easing the suffering of Syrians and has not pressured the regime that it claims it is a guarantor by move in any real path towards a solution, the rebel statement said. Russia, which has emerged as the dominant player in Syria after a major military intervention over two years ago, received backing from Turkey and Iran for holding a Syrian national dialogue congress in the Russian city of Sochi on Jan. 29-30. Russia is an aggressor country that has committed war crimes again",

The two U.S. allies are seeking to boost cooperation over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, despite lingering tension between them over the issue of comfort women , a Japanese euphemism for women - many of them Korean - forced to work in Japanese military brothels before and during World War Two. Ties have been frozen over the issue, with South Korean President Moon Jae-in promising to renegotiate a 2015 pact signed with Japan that is unpopular in South Korea.",
            "Turkey intends to open an embassy in East Jerusalem, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday, days after leading calls at a summit of Muslim leaders for the world to recognize it as the capital of Palestine. It was not clear how he would carry out the move, as Israel controls all of Jerusalem and calls the city its indivisible capital. Palestinians want the capital of a future state they seek to be in East Jerusalem, which Israel took in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally. The Muslim nation summit was a response to U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. His move broke with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city's status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. Erdogan said in a speech to members of his AK Party in the southern province of Karaman that Turkey's consulate general in Jerusalem was already represented by an ambassador. God wi",
            "Pope Francis and Jordan's King Abdullah on Tuesday discussed U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move that both say is dangerous to Middle East peace. Abdullah and the pope spoke privately for about 20 minutes at the start of the king's visit to the Vatican and France. A Vatican statement said they discussed the promotion of peace and stability in the Mideast, with particular reference to the question of Jerusalem and the role of the Hashemite Sovereign as Custodian of the Holy Places . King Abdullah's Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city. When Trump announced his decision on Dec. 6, the pope responded by calling for the city's status quo to be respected, saying new tension in the Middle East would further inflame world conflicts. Among an outpouring of international criticism, Jordan also rejected the U",
            "The Russian Communist Party on Saturday unexpectedly dropped its veteran leader Gennady Zyuganov as its presidential candidate to challenge President Vladimir Putin next year, choosing instead a largely unknown businessman with links to the farm sector. Zyuganov, 73, an evergreen of the post-Soviet political scene, had been widely expected to contest his sixth consecutive presidential election next March. But instead the party picked Pavel Grudinin, 57, a mechanical engineer who has run a farm on the outskirts of Moscow since the mid-1990s, as its candidate to take on Putin in an election which the 65-year-old Kremlin leader is expected to win comfortably. Zyuganov congratulated Grudinin on his nomination at an annual gathering of the party on Saturday, the Communist Party said on its website. By ditching one of the communist old guard as candidate and choosing someone from a new generation, the party appeared to be attempting to widen its political appeal. Its m",

The collision on Thursday afternoon ripped the bus apart and authorities worked into the night to identify the first victims. The official death toll came after a source close to the investigation earlier said six youngsters had lost their lives in an incident that stunned the small community of Millas, near Perpignan. Hospitals appealed for blood to help them treat seven others who remain in a critical condition. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the cause of the crash was still unclear.

Nasralla's comments, made in a video posted on Facebook, followed a decision by the nation's electoral tribunal to declare conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez the official winner of the vote. The announcement sparked calls for renewed street protests. Nasralla said he had meetings planned with the U.S. State Department and the Organization of American States.",

The country is used to lengthy transitions but this is the longest since reunification in 1990. It is 87 days since the election and few experts see a government in place before March. EU leaders fear delays to euro zone integration plans, some of which are to strengthen the banking system, and many economists warn Europe's biggest economy must reform and invest in broadband and infrastructure to stay competitive. But as caretaker chancellor, Merkel is voting at EU summits, parliament is passing laws required by international mandates, local authorities are wading through asylum applications and a bright outlook in Europe's biggest economy is buoying the mood.

            "The United Nations plans to move up to 10,000 illegal migrants from Libya next year, a senior U.N. official said on Tuesday, in a bid to relieve the plight of thousands stranded in deteriorating conditions in detention centers there. Libya is the main departure point for migrants fleeing poverty or war to reach Europe by boat as smugglers exploit turmoil gripping the country since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. Illegal migrant arrivals in Italy have fallen by two-thirds since July from the same period last year since the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, Italy's partner, cut back human smuggling at one major hub. Italy also helps in the Libyan coast guard's operations. But activists say the push has led to worsening of conditions in detention centers, where Human Rights Watch and other groups say migrants face overcrowding, abuse, lack of medical facilities and a shortage of food. The U.N. is repatriating migrants to African countries willing to take them",

On Monday she will report back to parliament on those talks, setting out the framework of a time-limited implementation period designed to smooth Britain's EU exit and provide clarity for businesses and citizens. This will help give certainty to employers and families that we are going to deliver a smooth Brexit, May will say, adding that the guidelines agreed last week point to a shared desire with the EU to make rapid progress on a deal.

North Korea's government-backed hackers have been blamed for a rising number of cyber attacks, including the so-called WannaCry cyber attack that crippled hospitals, banks and other companies across the globe this year. Analysts say the explosive growth in the value of bitcoin makes it and other cryptocurrencies an attractive target for North Korea, which has become increasingly isolated under international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and missile programs.

Authorities were conducting post-mortem examinations on Saturday and treating the deaths as suspicious. A Toronto Police spokesman said that nothing had been ruled out in the probe. Two Canadian newspapers reported that police were investigating the deaths as a possible murder-suicide, citing unidentified police sources. The bodies were found hanging from a railing on the edge of a basement swimming pool, the Globe and Mail and Toronto Sun reported, citing police sources.

It said Kim was reportedly a key figure in North Korea's efforts to switch its missile program from liquid to solid fuel, while Ri was reported to be a key official involved in the country's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) development.

The bill passed by the assembly is one of three that have triggered street protests across the country, a European Union state ranked as one of the bloc's most corrupt, and drawn opposition from thousands of magistrates. The three bills jointly limit magistrates independence and set up a special unit to probe crimes committed by magistrates. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a prosecuting unit dedicated to investigating them.

Merkel spoke by telephone with Poroshenko on Friday, a day after she spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said Merkel's deputy spokesman Georg Streiter. Merkel and Poroshenko welcomed a decision by the parties to recommit to a ceasefire agreement signed in 2015 ahead of the Christmas holiday, and both agreed it should lead to a longer-term improvement of the security situation in the region. A Russian-backed separatist insurgency erupted in 2014 and bloodshed has continued despite the ceasefire. More than 10,000 people have been killed, with casualties reported on a near-daily basis. Poroshenko and Merkel underscored the importance of an agreement by the parties to exchange prisoners, calling it an important step t",
            "The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Monday on a draft resolution calling for the withdrawal of U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, diplomats said, a move likely to face a Washington veto. The one-page Egyptian-drafted text, seen by Reuters, does not specifically mention the United States or Trump. Diplomats say it has broad support among the 15-member council, and while it is unlikely to be adopted, the vote will further isolate Trump on the issue. To pass, a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Britain, Russia or China. Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has praised Trump's decision as the just and right thing to do.",

Tensions between Iran and France have risen in recent months after Macron said Tehran should be less aggressive in the Middle East, citing in particular its involvement in Syria's civil war. Macron, unlike Trump, has reaffirmed his country's commitment to the deal Iran signed in 2015 with world powers under which it curbed its disputed nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions. However, he has been critical of Iran's ballistic missile tests and wants to raise the possibility of new sanctions over the program, which Tehran calls solely defensive in nature. To sustain its international credibility, France should not blindly follow the Americans ... The French president is now acting as Trump's lapdog, Ali Akbar Velayati, the to",

Ulyukayev, the most senior serving official to be arrested in decades, was found guilty of accepting the bribe last year from Rosneft (ROSN.MM) chief executive Igor Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. Sechin took part in an elaborate sting operation on Nov. 14 2016 involving Russia's FSB security service which ended in the arrest of Ulyukayev, 61, the latest twist in what several sources said was a Kremlin turf war.

General Assembly session. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, whose country has led Muslim opposition to Washington's stance on Jerusalem, was speaking before leaving Istanbul with the Palestinian foreign minister to attend Thursday's gathering in New York. With his Dec. 6 decision, President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy, and upset an international consensus enshrined in U.N. resolutions, that treated Jerusalem's status as unresolved. Israel captured East Jerusalem in a 1967 war and Palestinians want it as the capital of a future state they seek. Trump's move stirred outrage among Palestinians and in the Arab world, and concern among Washington's Western allies. On Monday, the United States vetoed a U.N.

U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the weapons included Javelin anti-tank missiles.

The three bills change the process of appointing chief prosecutors and set up a special unit to probe crimes committed by magistrates, making them the only professional category with a prosecuting unit dedicated to investigating them.

The last time the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) entered government in Austria, demonstrations were so big that the cabinet took a tunnel from the chancellery to the swearing-in ceremony at the president's office across the street.

She pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana shortly after the incident and was sentenced to 18 months on probation. In the lawsuit she later filed jointly with a child rights group, the young woman said the photos humiliated her and sought legal compensation. Kenyan high court judge John Mativo said in his ruling that the student was entitled to the four million shillings ($38,815) because her constitutional rights to dignity had been violated.

            "Italy's ruling Democratic Party (PD) has lost further ground over its rivals after political infighting and fallout from a banking scandal, an opinion poll showed on Sunday. The poll comes just weeks before parliament is expected to be dissolved before elections early next year. The PD share of the vote fell 1 percent, from eight days ago, to 23.4 percent, its lowest level in five years, according to the Ipsos poll in the newspaper Corriere della Sera. Support for the PD, headed by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, has fallen steadily in recent months, with the group damaged by deep schisms and personality clashes. The party has also come under fire over allegations cabinet undersecretary Maria Elena Boschi took steps to try to save Banca Etruria, a local bank based in her home town of Arezzo. Boschi has repeatedly denied exerting any political pressure in deciding the future of Banca Etruria. The Ipsos poll said growing support from smaller allies had raised the c",

            "Indonesia's vice president said on Tuesday that calls for a boycott of U.S. goods over President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel were misguided - not least because of the country's reliance on U.S. technology. There have been a series of protests in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country since Trump's controversial move this month to reverse decades of U.S. policy. At a rally of about 80,000 people on Sunday, the Indonesian Ulema Council, a body of Muslim clerics, called for a boycott of U.S. and Israeli products if Trump did not revoke his action. Vice President Jusuf Kalla told reporters that Indonesia was trying to put pressure on Washington through the United Nations and it was not even practical to stop using American products. Do not be emotional... do we dare to boycott iPhones, stop using Google. Can (you) live without them? he asked. (You) cannot live without them now. If you go out of the house now, you",
            "The U.N. independent expert on the independence of judges and lawyers criticized Poland on Friday for legal reforms that have already attracted unprecedented censure from the European Union, dubbing them a serious breach of the rule of law. Diego Garc a-Say n, a special rapporteur mandated by the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the independence of judges and lawyers, said Poland's newly adopted laws threatened the independence of the judiciary. These new laws are part of a larger plan aimed at placing the judiciary under the political control of the ruling party, Garc a-Say n said in a statement. He said Poland had been comprehensively reforming its judicial system since parliamentary elections in 2015, aiming to increase its effectiveness and restore public trust. Such reforms were a legitimate objective, he added. What is happening in Poland today, however, is a vicious attempt to place the whole judicial system under the control of the executive and",
            "Libyan families displaced from a town ransacked after the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 will be allowed to return home in February, the U.N.-backed government said on Tuesday after more than a year of negotiations. The deal, if implemented, would be a step toward reconciliation in the North African oil producing country, which is heavily divided between competing factions, communities, tribes and governments since 2011. Residents of the town of Tawergha were expelled by former anti-Gaddafi rebels in 2011 in retaliation for the strongman having used their settlement as a launch pad for attacks on the western city of Misrata during the uprising. They have been living in camps and makeshift settlements in poverty across Libya and were banned from returning home. They faced abuse and arbitrary arrest since videos surfaced purportedly showing some of them joining Gaddafi forces in 2011.

Djalali was arrested in Iran in April 2016 and later convicted of espionage. He has denied the charges, Amnesty said. At least four scientists were killed between 2010 and 2012 in what Tehran said were assassinations meant to sabotage its efforts to develop nuclear energy.

Authorities blamed the outage, which began around noon (1600 GMT), on the collapse of an important cable linking a power plant and a transmission tower. The fault affected some phone lines, parts of the Caracas metro, and the main Maiquetia airport just outside the capital. Many workers had no choice but to walk home, shops and restaurants closed, and Venezuelans grumbled that another day was disrupted by tumult.

            "Japan's government approved a record military budget on Friday but did not earmark enough extra money to stop a splurge on U.S.-made ballistic missile defense kit from putting a squeeze on funding for an ambitious domestic jet fighter project. Japan's defense outlays for the year starting April 1 will rise for a sixth straight year, increasing by 1.3 percent to 5.19 trillion yen ($45.76 billion), according to a budget breakdown published by the government. The biggest ticket item is 137 billion yen to reinforce defenses against a possible North Korean ballistic missile attack. That includes purchases of a new longer range interceptor, the SM-3 Block IIA, designed to strike ballistic missiles in space, upgrades for the Patriot missile batteries that are the last line of defense against incoming warheads and preparations for the construction of two ground-based Aegis radar stations.

Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring what it considers a wayward province and sacred Chinese territory under its rule. Writing in the influential state-run newspaper the Study Times, Liu Junchuan, who heads the liaison office of China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, said it was inevitable Taiwan would come under China's control.

Over the past two years, countries including Kenya, Spain, Vietnam and Cambodia have deported hundreds of people from Taiwan to China for telecoms fraud, sparking accusations from Taipei that Beijing was effectively kidnapping its citizens. China has defended the deportations, saying the crimes were committed against people in China and that as Taiwan is a part of China. The Beijing court said in a statement that one of the Taiwanese, Chang Kai-min, had been jailed for 15 years for helping scam 185 people out of more than 29 million yuan ($4.4 million).

The Independent said the lead for remain over leave was the biggest in any poll so far since the vote in June 2016.

Eighteen smaller satellites belonging to scientific, research and commercial companies from Russia, Norway, Sweden, the United States, Japan, Canada and Germany, were on board the same rocket. Speaking to Rossiya 24 state TV channel, Rogozin said the failure had been caused by human error.

            "A dozen Arab ambassadors have asked India to clarify its position on the U.S recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, diplomatic sources said, after New Delhi's muted response suggested a shift in support for the Palestinian cause. U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy this month when he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, generating outrage from Palestinians. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Countries around the world, including U.S. allies Britain and France, criticized Trump's decision, but India did not take sides. Instead, the Indian foreign ministry in a brief statement, said India's position was consistent and independent of any third party. The bland statement made no reference to Jerusalem and prompted criticism at home that it was insufficient, vague and anti-Palestinian. Israel maintains that all of Jerusalem is its capital. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital o",

            "Ugandan legislators voted late on Wednesday to amend the country's constitution to allow 73-year-old leader Yoweri Museveni to extend his rule, potentially guaranteeing him a life-time presidency. A provision in the current constitution limits the age of a presidential candidate at 75 years, which would have made Museveni ineligible to stand at the next polls in 2021. At the end of Wednesday's day-long House debate, which capped a protracted and violence-marred process to remove that age limit, MPs voted 315-62 in favor of the amendment. The bill passes, said speaker Rebecca Kadaga after announcing tally results, prompting raucous celebrations from the mostly ruling party MPs who favored the bill. Earlier in the day, two lawmakers were dragged away and detained when they tried to enter parliament, as the divisive debate proceeded in the chamber. Police had blocked some legislators from entering the building, and live television footage showed two of them being",

Iraqi forces are still working to discover the exact locations from which the shelling has come and the identity of those responsible, she said. The shelling of the ethnically-mixed town happened after many of its Kurdish population was displaced following clashes with Turkmen paramilitary groups. Tuz Khurmatu is made up of Turkmen, Kurds and Arabs located 75 km (47 miles) south of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.

Human Rights Now Secretary-General Kazuko Ito told Reuters that Japan should send a stronger message about the arrests.

Slow progress establishing an independent court to deal with corruption cases has been one of the main obstacles to the disbursement of loans under a $17.5 billion aid-for-reforms program from the Fund. President Petro Poroshenko has promised to submit a draft law to set up such a court, but first parliament needed to vote to withdraw a similar bill that did not meet recommendations by a leading European rights watchdog. The motion was backed by 235 lawmakers, slightly more than the 226 required to pass. A government source told Reuters the president would submit the new law to parliament by the end of this week.

Indonesia's national disaster management agency said the quake activated early tsunami warning systems in the south of Java, prompting thousands to evacuate from some coastal areas, but no tsunami was detected. Tremors were felt in central and west Java. Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the disaster agency, said in a press briefing on Saturday three people had been killed, seven injured and hundreds of buildings damaged, including schools, hospitals, and government buildings in West and Central Java. Dozens of patients had to be helped to safety from a hospital in Banyumas and were given shelter in tents, he said. He posted on his Twitt",
            "Russia's ruling party United Russia wants the ultimate victory of President Vladimir Putin at the presidential election in March, party head and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Saturday. Putin, 65, said earlier this month he would run for re-election as a self-nominated candidate, in a contest he seems sure to win comfortably, extending his grip on power into a third decade. Speaking at an annual gathering of United Russia, Medvedev said the party was Putin's party, and his key political resource. Medvedev promised it would support Putin in the election, which is scheduled for March 18. We will give you, Vladimir Vladimirovich, all possible support, now and in the future, said Medvedev, addressing Putin by his first and patronymic names. Putin has been in power since 2000 either as president or prime minister. If he wins what would be a fourth presidential term, he will be eligible to serve another six years until 2024, when he turns 72. Putin thanked",
            "Syrian rebels in a pocket of land near where the Syrian, Lebanese and Israeli borders meet are negotiating a deal with the government to leave for other insurgent-held areas, rebel officials there said. The Syrian army, backed by Russian air power, Shi ite militias supported by Iran and local fighters from the Druze sect have besieged the rebel enclave around Beit Jin for weeks. In recent days it captured various positions, leaving the rebels trapped inside the town itself. There is now negotiation on the departure of fighters and those who wish to leave with them, said Abu Kanaan, an official in a local rebel group. The militias are trying to convince them to evacuate to Idlib... There has been no agreement reached yet, said Ibrahim al-Jebawi, an official with a Free Syrian Army faction familiar with the situation. Syria's army and its allies have increasingly pushed for such evacuation deals for rebel enclaves near big cities or in other strategic locations a",
            "Turkey told U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday he could not buy its support in a United Nations vote on Jerusalem, and said the world should teach the United States a very good lesson by resisting U.S. pressure. Trump has threatened to cut aid to countries that support a draft U.N. resolution calling for the United States to withdraw its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in Ankara U.N. member states should not let their decision in Thursday's vote at the U.N. General Assembly be dictated by money. Mr. Trump, you cannot buy Turkey's democratic will with your dollars, he said. The dollars will come back, but your will won t once it's sold. That is why your stance is important. Trump's announcement two weeks ago that he was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital broke with decades of U.S. policy and international consensus that the city's status must be left to Israeli-Palestinian talks.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Monday laid out a national security strategy based on Trump's America First vision, singling out of China and Russia as revisionist powers seeking not only to challenge U.S. power but to erode its security and prosperity. China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday cooperation between China and the United States was the only correct choice. The spokesman for its defense ministry, Ren Guoqiang, said in a statement posted on the ministry website late on Wednesday that the U.S. strategy had without regard for the facts, created sensational hype over the modernization of China's defenses .

            "An interim review into UK building regulations commissioned after the Grenfell Tower social housing block fire in London which killed 71 people in June, has called for a culture change in respect to fire safety. The review, sponsored by the Department For Communities and Local Government (DCLG), said the building industry aimed for minimum compliance , that enforcement measures were poor and that competence levels among builders and regulators was weak. It has become clear that the whole system of regulation, covering what is written down and the way in which it is enacted in practice, is not fit for purpose, leaving room for those who want to take shortcuts to do so, the review said. The Grenfell fire was started by a fridge-freezer but spread quickly, partly because of the use of flammable cladding panels which were afixed to the outside of the 24-storey building, experts have said. The contractor who retrofitted the external insulation on the building said t",

We want to build a stable government, Merkel said. This means that the success of the exploratory talks means, in the view of the CDU, as well as the CSU, that we need to reach agreement on specific issues during the exploratory talks. From our perspective, anything short of that would mean the exploratory talks were not successful, Merkel added.",

Prime Minister Theresa May lost her Conservative Party its majority in parliament by betting on a snap election in June, weakening her hand in Brexit negotiations. Labour by contrast did well at the election, making a net gain of 30 seats in Britain's 650-seat parliament. Corbyn, a lifelong socialist, who has repeatedly claimed that he will win power, said there would soon be another election. There will probably be another election in the next 12 months, he was quoted by Grazia as saying. He predicted his Labour Party would win. I m ready to be Prime Minister tomorrow, Corbyn said.

            "Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday she would permit a delay to Britain's departure from the European Union in exceptional circumstances, bowing to criticism from her own party over the government's plan to fix the exit date in law. The decision is a compromise with Conservative lawmakers who last week rebelled in parliament and inflicted an embarrassing defeat on May during a debate on the legislation that will end Britain's EU membership. The legislation, formally titled the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, later won approval to move to the next stage of the parliamentary process, although it still faces weeks of further scrutiny before becoming law. May headed off a second rebellion by agreeing that her government's plan to define the date of Britain's EU exit as March 29, 2019, should be tempered by inserting a proviso allowing that date to be changed if necessary. If that power were to be used, it would be only in extremely exceptional circumstances",

If Kuczynski is as expected unseated by the opposition-run Congress in a vote on Thursday, First Vice President Martin Vizcarra would immediately replace him. New national elections would only be called if both Vizcarra - a former governor of a copper-rich mining region and Peru's current ambassador to Canada - and Araoz resigned or left office before the scheduled end of Kuczynski's term in 2021.

There was no immediate word on who opened fire from Syrian territory, but forces arrayed against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria expect the group will resort to guerrilla warfare after losing its urban bastions earlier this year. After several Iraqi border guard positions came under several attacks by missiles, and backup from security forces was late, the 13th brigade of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) was deployed and targeted the origins of the launch, PMF commander for west Anbar, Qassem Mesleh, said in a statement.

Around 99 percent of Algeria's population is Sunni Muslim but the number of Christians has been rising due to an influx of migrants from sub-Saharan countries such as Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The market, organized by the Caritas charity, is also a sign of stable security in a country that has rebounded from a decade of Islamist militant violence during which 200,000 people died. Diplomats used to hunker down in fortified embassies, rarely venturing out, but now live alongside Algerians in residential quarters. No militant attack has been reported in Algiers for more than 10 years. Caritas staged a similar Christmas market last year but kept it low profile. This year it advertised the market in advance, calling for a living together between Christians and Muslims. No official",

The North African country has two rival governments, one in the east and a U.N.-backed administration in the capital Tripoli in the west, in a conflict stemming from the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Atilla's lawyers immediately objected before Atilla could answer, and U.S. District Judge Richard Berman ordered the question stricken from the record. However, Atilla's lawyers said Wednesday that the damage had been done.

They didn t like the word, but I stand by it, le Drian told reporters. Iran's hegemonic temptations in the region is a matter of urgency because it",
            "Syrian rebels in a pocket of land near where the Syrian, Lebanese and Israeli borders meet are negotiating a deal with the government to leave for other insurgent-held areas, rebel officials there said. The Syrian army, backed by Russian air power, Shi ite militias supported by Iran and local fighters from the Druze sect have besieged the rebel enclave around Beit Jin for weeks. In recent days it captured various positions, leaving the rebels trapped inside the town itself. There is now negotiation on the departure of fighters and those who wish to leave with them, said Abu Kanaan, an official in a local rebel group. The militias are trying to convince them to evacuate to Idlib... There has been no agreement reached yet, said Ibrahim al-Jebawi, an official with a Free Syrian Army faction familiar with the situation. Syria's army and its allies have increasingly pushed for such evacuation deals for rebel enclaves near big cities or in other strategic locations a",
            "Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa appointed retired army boss Constantino Chiwenga and veteran politician Kembo Mohadi as the ruling party's vice presidents, a spokesperson said on Saturday. The appointments paved the way for the two to ascend to similar positions in government, officials said. Mnangagwa, who took over last month from 93-year-old Robert Mugabe after the intervention of the military, is under pressure from opposition parties and the public to implement political reforms. Under Mugabe's 37-year rule political space was limited, with the latter part of his reign marked by the emergence of a ZANU-PF faction aligned to his wife Grace that threatened to usurp the army's central role in government. Chiwenga, who retired from the army on Monday, is the latest in a string of senior military figures appointed by Mnangagwa to important political posts. Presidential spokesman George Charamba said Chiwenga and Mohadi's appointments as vice presidents of",

The blast comes a week after the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a training facility of the same agency, the National Directorate for Security, in Kabul that ended when the attackers were killed before causing significant casualties. In a statement issued through the group's Amaq news agency, Islamic State said it was also behind Monday's attack. In Kabul, security officials said the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber who approached the agency's entrance on foot before blowing himself up. All the casualties reported were of civilian passersby. Najib Danish, a spokesman for the interior ministry, said at least five people were killed and two wounded.

When he was foreign minister, Kurz, a conservative now governing in coalition with the far-right Freedom Party, was a strong critic of Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open Germany's borders to more than a million fleeing migrants in 2015. Since becoming Chancellor this week, he has aligned himself with central European neighbors like Hungary and the Czech Republic in opposing German-backed proposals to distribute asylum seekers around EU member states. Forcing states to take refugees doesn t take Europe any further. The discussion makes no sense, he told Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper. Migrants who set off for Europe don t want to go to Bulgaria or Hungary. They want to go to Germany, Austria or Sweden. Instead of doubling",

Interfax cited a draft regulation from the justice ministry. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law last month that allowed the authorities to designate foreign media outlets as foreign agents in response to what Moscow said was unacceptable U.S. pressure on Russian media. So far, it has been exclusively used to label media sponsored by the U.S. authorities as foreign agents, but the new regulation would appear to go further.

Ramaphosa's ability has been apparent for decades. Whenever Nelson Mandela needed a breakthrough in talks to end apartheid, he turned to the then-trade union leader with a reputation as a tenacious negotiator. Using skills honed in pay disputes with mining bosses, Ramaphosa steered those talks to a successful conclusion, allowing Mandela to sweep to power in 1994 as head of the victorious ANC after South Africa's first democratic vote. Mandela wanted Ramaphosa to be his heir but was pressured into picking Thabo Mbeki by a group of ANC leaders who had fought apartheid from exile.

In those hardest hit by crises Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Sudan an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said in its annual report on food security. A quarter of Yemen's people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times. The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000. It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. But it had worsened in conf",

Al-Sanea was freed late last week after being detained in October for unpaid debts, related at least in part to the hospital, according to the sources.

I was told from my boss this morning that our Chinese partners (based in Beijing and Shandong) said they won t send group tourists to South Korea as of January, the official from Naeil Tour Agency told Reuters by phone.

Gruevski, 47, resigned earlier this month following an election defeat last year and unrest that rocked the small Balkan country in April. In his speech to the party's convention on Saturday, Gruevski said that a key reason for VMRO-DPMNE's fall from power was his refusal to yield to what he described as international and domestic pressure to accept a compromise in a dispute with Greece. Macedonia, which won independence in 1991 from then-federal Yugoslavia, has made little progress towards EU and NATO membership due to a long-running dispute with Greece which claims Macedonia's name represents a territorial claim to its province with the same name.

It is a very bad decision. The consequences will be more bloodshed, more conflict rather than peaceful resolution, Prince Turki, a senior royal family member and a former ambassador to Washington, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday in Riyadh. Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and veered from international consensus this month by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Most countries say the city's status must be left to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Saudi Arabia condemned the decision.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a new package of sanctions in August drafted by U.S. lawmakers. One of the provisions asked the U.S. Treasury Secretary to submit a report on the impact of expanding sanctions to cover Russian sovereign debt, with an outcome expected as early as February. U.S. and EU sanctions imposed over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, and its support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, remain in place. But U.S. allegations that Moscow interfered in last year's U.S. presidential election, something Russia denies, have spurred calls for more sanctions.

Mnangagwa, giving his first state of the nation address since he assumed power last month following a de facto coup that ousted his 93-year-old predecessor, has sought to draw a line under years of endemic corruption and impunity. Under pressure to deliver results, especially on an economy crippled by severe currency shortages, Mnangagwa said reforms of a bloated state sector would be launched in early 2018. With opposition parties calling for widespread political reforms before an election next year, he repeated a promise that his government would do everything in its power to ensure a credible, free and fair ballot.

Allies have identified a Russian missile system that raises serious concerns, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation said in a statement. NATO urges Russia to address these concerns in a substantial and transparent way, and actively engage in a technical dialogue with the United States.

            "The European Union wants a transition period after Brexit to end no later than the last day of 2020, according to the European Commission's negotiating directives agreed on Wednesday. That date, coinciding with the end of the EU's seven-year budget period and 21 months after Britain departs the EU, had long been expected as the target end point of the transition. But this was the first official confirmation that it is the goal of the Union's negotiators. British Prime Minister Theresa May had sought a transition lasting around two years. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, speaking at a news conference after the EU executive had agreed the terms, said the 2020 deadline was logical and would avoid complications in the next 2021-2027 EU budget period. The four pages of new directives for Barnier were in line with guidelines issued by EU leaders at a summit on Friday and will form the basis of talks on the transition that he hopes to start next month.

            "The United States announced sanctions on two of North Korea's most prominent officials behind its ballistic missile program on Tuesday, while Russia reiterated an offer to mediate to ease tension between Washington and Pyongyang. The new U.S. steps were the latest in a campaign aimed at forcing North Korea - which has defied years of multilateral and bilateral sanctions - to abandon a weapons program aimed at developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States. Treasury is targeting leaders of North Korea's ballistic missile programs, as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate (North Korea) and achieve a fully denuclearized Korean Peninsula, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. The move followed new United Nations sanctions announced last Friday in response to North Korea's Nov. 29 test of an ICBM that Pyongyang said put all of the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons.

Kosovo police arrested 19 people in November 2016 on suspicion that they had links with the Islamic State militant group and were planning attacks in Kosovo and neighboring Albania. Nine of them were charged. The state prosecutor said some of them were in contact with Lavdrim Muhaxheri, Islamic State's self-declared commander of Albanians in Syria and Iraq , who ordered them to attack. Police said Muhaxheri was killed in June this year. ... I accept guilty plea, defendant Kenan Plakaj said in court.

            "A former Korean Air Lines executive who went into a rage on an aircraft over the way she was served nuts in first class avoided jail on Thursday when South Korea's Supreme Court upheld her 10-month suspended sentence. Heather Cho had been charged with, among others, violation of aviation law in 2015 after she took issue with the way she was served nuts and forced the Korean Air Lines plane to return to its gate in a New York airport in December 2014. The incident became a national scandal in South Korea, as Cho is the daughter of the chairman of Hanjin Group, the conglomerate of which Korean Air is an affiliate. Cho stepped down from her role as Korean Air Lines vice president and attempted to apologize to crew members. The Supreme Court upheld an appeals court ruling that said forcing an on-the-ground plane to return to its gate cannot be seen as route deviation, but found Cho guilty of abusive language and actions against cabin crew and forcing a crew member to",

Given the flaws of the Iraqi justice system, it also appears extremely doubtful that strict due process and fair trial guarantees were followed in these 38 cases. This raises the prospect of irreversible miscarriages of justice and violations of the right to life. The 38 male prisoners were convicted by Iraq's judiciary for terrorism-related crimes, she said.

This is a case about lies, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Lockard told the jury, saying Atilla lied to U.S. authorities that Halkbank was complying with sanctions. Halkbank has denied involvement in illegal activities. Lockard pointed to the testimony of Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who was charged in the case but pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecutors. Zarrab testified that Atilla helped design fraudulent gold and food transactions that allowed Iran to spend its oil and gas revenues abroad, including through U.S. financial institutions, defying U.S. sanct",

Lawmakers from the governing coalition, who hold a majority, are pressing for a vote to abolish the court. The vote was scheduled for later in the day but it failed twice due to opposition from other parties. Parliament speaker Kadri Veseli said parliament would continue to attempt to vote on the issue in the coming days. Isa Mustafa, Kosovo's former prime minister and an opposition leader, said the proposal was devastating for our state and very damaging for justice .

A round of Syria peace talks that ended on Thursday was a big missed opportunity, but there may be more talks in January if ideas can be found to encourage President Bashar al-Assad's government to engage, U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday. There is no alternative to a negotiated political solution agreed by both parties under the auspices of the United Nations, deputy foreign ministry spokesman Alexandre Georgini told reporters in a daily briefing, reiterating Paris support for de Mistura. We deplore the attitude of the Syrian regime, which has refused to engage in the discussion. The Syrian regime is responsible for the lack of progress in the negotiations, he said.",

China has conducted extensive land reclamation work on some of the islands and reefs it controls in the South China Sea, including building airports, alarming its neighbors and Washington. Beijing says the work is help provide international services such as search-and-rescue but admits there is a military purpose too. China also says it can do whatever it wants on its territory.

Reagan was more powerful and smarter than Trump, and he was a better actor in making threats, and he also moved against us and they shot down our plane, Khamenei said in a speech carried on state television. In 1988, a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian passenger plane over the Gulf, killing all 290 aboard, in an incident which Washington said was a mistake. Tehran said it was a deliberate attack on Iran, then at war with neighboring Iraq.

The ARA San Juan was delivered in 1985 and built by a unit of Thyssen AG, which merged with Krupp to form Thyssenkrupp in 1999. We have offered our support for the technical investigation into this tragedy and are in contact with the Argentinian navy in this respect, the spokesman said. He said maintenance of the submarine was not conducted by Thyssenkrupp. The submarine went missing on Nov. 15 with 44 crew members aboard in South Atlantic waters. The navy said on Nov. 27 that water that entered the submarine's snorkel caused its battery to short circuit before it went missing. The tragedy underscored what some critics have described as the parlous state of Argentina's military, which has faced dwindling funding for years.

The U.N. resolution seeks to ban nearly 90 percent of refined petroleum exports to North Korea by capping them at 500,000 barrels a year and, in a last-minute change, demands the repatriation of North Koreans working abroad within 24 months, instead of 12 months as first proposed.

But for some EU nationals - who have endured uncertainty over their rights since the Brexit vote in June 2016, not to mention an unpleasant feeling that many Britons do not want them around - May's Dec. 8 deal is too little, too late.

In April, the hijacked truck sped down a busy street in Stockholm and mowed down shoppers before crashing into a department store, killing three Swedes, a British citizen and a person from Belgium. The youngest victim was 11. The preliminary investigation is almost complete, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Hans Ihrman at the National Security Unit said. As it looks at the moment, we will be able to start the trial at the beginning of February, he told TV4. There is one suspect, no others.

            "French president Emmanuel Macron's popularity jumped back above 50 percent thanks in part to better ratings among the young and the working class, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, confirming a rebound that started at the beginning of December. Macron's popularity dropped quickly after he swept to an electoral victory in May on a centrist platform, shattering a long-standing two-party system in France. But while the former investment banker has struggled to shake off a president of the rich tag pinned on him by rivals for policies such as cuts in housing benefits, Macron's efforts to defend French interests abroad have helped lift his ratings. His popularity rose above 50 percent for the first time since his election in early December, and a new poll on Wednesday, taken on Monday and Tuesday, showed the president scoring a 52 percent approval rating. That was a six-percentage-point jump from November, according to the BVA poll, carried out for Orange and La Tr",

Rustam Inoyatov, NSS chairman since 1995, is the only Karimov-era senior security official still in his post, one year into Mirziyoyev's presidency.

Trump's planned visit to Britain has proved controversial since Prime Minister Theresa May invited him for a state visit, which typically involves lavish pageantry and events hosted by the queen. However nearly 2 million people have signed a petition saying Trump should not be invited because it would cause embarrassment to the queen, and protests could be expected to greet the U.S. leader. The Daily Mail cited a source in Westminster as saying Trump had told May during a call on Tuesday that he planned a working visit to Britain to open the new embassy, a billion-dollar building which overlooks the River Thames, in late February. A spokesman for May's Downing Street office declined to comment on the report. He said the position on the state visit had not changed. An offer had been exte",

In contrast, a U.N. human rights spokesman said coalition air strikes had killed at least 136 noncombatants in war-torn Yemen since Dec. 6.

The deal has caused concern in the West because Turkey is a member of NATO but the Russian missile system cannot be integrated into NATO's military architecture. In addition, relations between Moscow and the Western military alliance are strained, in part because of Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Turkish Defence Minister Nurettin Canikli said Ankara would purchase two S-400 systems and four batteries and that all agreements were made, the state broadcaster TRT Haber reported. Turkey will pay 45 percent of the cost up front with Russia providing loans to cover the remaining 55 percent, Chemezov said. Moscow expected to begin the first deliveries in March 2020, he said.

Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban's conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang.

            "Food security in the Middle East and North Africa is quickly deteriorating because of conflict in several countries in the region, the United Nations said on Thursday. In those hardest hit by crises Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Sudan an average of more than a quarter of the population was undernourished, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said in its annual report on food security. A quarter of Yemen's people are on the brink of famine, several years into a proxy war between the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi that has caused one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in recent times. The report focused on changes to food security and nutrition across the region since 2000. It said that undernourishment in countries not directly affected by conflict, such as most Gulf Arab states and most North African countries including Egypt, had slowly improved in the last decade. But it had worsened in conf",

Those who hope that Trump will cause its collapse, are wrong, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on State TV. In October, Trump declined to certify that Iran was complying with the nuclear agreement reached among Tehran, the United States and other powers in 2015. His decision triggered a 60-day window for Congress to decide whether to bring back sanctions on Iran. Congress passed the ball back to Trump by letting the deadline on reimposing sanctions on Iran pass last week. Trump must decide in mid-January if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on Iran. Under the deal, nuclear-related sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted last year, in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. Iran has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it, but",

            "The U.S. State Department has approved an export license for Ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from U.S. manufacturers, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Wednesday. Department records show Ukraine has bought small amounts of those types of weapons for several years, both before and after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. The department notified Congress of the decision on Dec. 13, Nauert said, adding that the U.S. government was not selling the weapons directly to the Kiev government but was allowing Ukraine to buy from U.S. manufacturers. Under the previous two administrations, the U.S. government has approved export licenses to Ukraine, so this is nothing new, Nauert said. The license covers weapons in categories such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms up to, and including, .50 caliber weapons. It also includes combat shotguns, silencers, military scopes, and flash suppressors, as well as parts. Nauert said",

The previous incumbent, Santiago Nieto, was fired by Mexico's acting attorney general in October on the grounds that he broke a code of conduct for officials. Nieto had given a newspaper interview in which he accused Emilio Lozoya, the former boss of state oil firm Pemex and a senior member of the president's 2012 campaign team, of writing to him to ask that he be declared innocent of funneling cash from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht into Pena Nieto's campaign.

            "Australia's conservative coalition government regained its razor-thin parliamentary majority on Saturday after inner Sydney voters re-elected a former professional tennis player in a special poll triggered by a constitutional crisis. The Liberal Party victory in the blue-ribbon Sydney seat of Bennelong is a much-needed relief for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose leadership has been increasingly unpopular with the public over the past two years. A loss in Bennelong would have plunged his government into a parliamentary minority, forcing it to rely on independent lawmakers to complete its agenda. A loss would also have placed Turnbull's personal position in danger. With around 73 percent of the two-party preferred vote counted by late Saturday, the opposition Labor Party candidate Kristina Keneally has secured a swing of about 5.6 percent against the Liberal Party's John Alexander, according to the Australian Electoral Commission. While a sizeable swing, that wa",

The government revealed in October the 58 economic sectors it had analyzed to help it prepare for leaving, but refused requests to publish them. Brexit minister David Davis said the reports contained excruciating detail and that their publication could undermine negotiations with the EU. However, lawmakers demanded to see the papers and used an unusual parliamentary procedure to compel the government to hand them over to a parliamentary committee. The committee published them on Thursday, but with some sensitive sections redacted. There is little or nothing in them that couldn t be learned",

Instead, thousands of Palestinian protesters, many of them throwing rocks, confronted Israeli security forces along the Gaza border fence, in all of occupied West Bank's seven cities and in East Jerusalem.

Cecilia Chacon, a lawmaker with the opposition party Popular Force, said the 10 abstentions by a faction in her party had helped defeat its bid to oust Kuczynski in the wake of a graft scandal, and that some of them had mentioned the promise. That's what they told us, Chacon said in broadcast comments. Earlier on Thursday, Kuczynski's government denied it was negotiating a possible pardon for Fujimori in exchange for votes to save him. Kuczynski pulled off a surprise victory after the motion in Congress to oust him fell eight votes short of the 87 needed to pass.

It has taken an increasingly hostile stance toward Taiwan since Tsai Ing-wen, from the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year and has stepped up its rhetoric and military exercises. Beijing suspects her of pushing for the island's formal independence, a red line for China. Tsai says she wants peace with China, but also that she will defend Taiwan's security and way of life.

Thursday's defection came about five weeks after a North Korean soldier suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash across the border. Two North Korean civilians were also found in a fishing boat on Wednesday and had sought to defect, officials in the South said. That brings the total number of North Koreans who have defected by taking dangerous routes either directly across the border or by sea to 15 so far this year, including two other soldiers.

But Zuma's presidency, tainted by corruption and scandal, has badly tarnished the ANC's image both at home and abroad. The party once led by Nelson Mandela is now deeply divided.

The Scottish Court of Session has accepted a petition from the cross-party group of seven MPs, excluding British Prime Minister Theresa May's ruling Conservatives, to determine whether Brexit can be stopped if Britain, acting alone, decides to reverse the process. The British government has three weeks to respond to the challenge, before the Edinburgh court - Scotland's supreme civil judicial body - sets a date to hear the case, a spokesman said. The seven MPs from the Labour Party, Scottish National Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens, want the Court of Sessions to refer the matter to the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court, to conclusively rule on the issue.

Taiwan dispatched its aircraft and ships to monitor and deal with the Yun8, which returned to its base after flying through the Bashi Channel and Miyako waterway, Defense Minister Feng Shih-kuan said. It was unclear whether one plane or more made the flight. There was no untoward incident and the public should not be alarmed, Feng said. He did not give further details. China has considered Taiwan to be a wayward province since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops fled to the island in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to Mao Zedong's Communist forces on the mainland.

Security sources meanwhile said an army officer and five militants had been killed in clashes as security forces carried out arrest raids near the Arish air base on Wednesday. The Amaq statement said Islamic State fighters used a Kornet anti-tank missile in the Tuesday attack that targeted the interior and defense ministers who were visiting the area. Neither minister was harmed, a security source said. Islamic State's Sinai branch has for years waged attacks against security forces, and in the past year expanded targets to include Christians and other civilians. An attack on a mosque last month which killed more than 300 people, the deadliest in Egypt's modern history, was widely attributed to Islamic State, but the group did not claim it.

A day earlier, Trump's administration had unveiled a security paper - based on the president's America First push - that accused Russia of interfering in other countries internal affairs. A quick read of the parts of the strategy that mention our country one way or another... (shows) an imperialist character, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. The paper, he added also showed an unwillingness to give up the idea of a unipolar world, moreover, an insistent unwillingness, disregard for a multipolar world. Trump's strategy paper did not include specific accusations from U.S. security agencies that Moscow meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.

That represents the first improvement in Temer's unfavorable rating since he took over last year from his predecessor Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached for breaking budget rules.

            "President Emmanuel Macron has said his government could consider changes in the relationship between mainland France and Corsica, which seeks greater autonomy, but ruled out new residency rights or recognition of Corsican as an official language. An alliance of Corsica's two main nationalist parties swept a local election on Dec. 10 and has been pressing for talks with Paris. Its leaders want more autonomy on fiscal issues, an equal status for the French and Corsican languages, and the limiting of the right to buy property in some areas to people who have been resident on the holiday island for at least five years. The two-party Pe a Corsica (For Corsica) alliance won nearly two thirds of seats in the local assembly election. Support for their cause is driven by dissatisfaction with France's mainstream parties, mirroring a trend that has spurred secessionist ambitions elsewhere in Europe, such as Catalonia.

            "French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that Bashar al-Assad was the enemy of millions of his own people and in no position to lecture France, after the Syrian leader accused Paris of supporting terrorism. After a string of strong comments by French officials blaming Assad's government for atrocities and failed talks, Assad said on Monday France was supporting bloodshed in Syria, making it unfit to talk about peace settlements. France spearheaded support for terrorism and their hands are soaked in Syrian blood from the first days and we do not see they have changed their stance fundamentally, Assad was quoted in state media as saying. Those who support terrorism have no right to talk about peace, Assad added. Despite being a leading backer of the Syrian opposition, France has sought a more pragmatic approach to the conflict since the arrival of Macron, saying that Assad's departure was not a pre-condition for talks to end the six-year war.

Films and TV program are often financed by selling exclusive distribution rights on a country-by-country basis. Rights to show sports, such as Premier League soccer matches, can fetch billions of pounds.

Earlier in the day, two lawmakers were dragged away and detained when they tried to enter parliament, as the divisive debate proceeded in the chamber. Police had blocked some legislators from entering the building, and live television footage showed two of them being",
            "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called on Monday for the United States and North Korea to start negotiations, the RIA news agency reported. Lavrov was cited as saying that Russia was ready to facilitate such negotiations. Moscow has long called for Washington and Pyongyang to hold talks aimed at de-escalating tensions around North Korea's nuclear and missile program. North Korea's foreign ministry said on Sunday that the latest U.N. sanctions against North Korea were an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade against it.",
            "Russia poses an increasing threat and is willing to use propaganda, subversion and cyber-attacks to undermine Britain and the rest of Europe, Britain's national security adviser said on Monday. Mark Sedwill, who is overseeing a review of Britain's security services, told a parliamentary committee that Russia is attempting to sow dissension and undermine democracy in Britain and other western nations. He said the threats from Russia included from unconventional warfare such as disinformation campaigns to the dangers posed from an increase in its military capability in the North Atlantic and in Eastern Europe. We know that the Russian threat is definitely intensifying and diversifying, Sedwill said. The Russian attitude has worsened more generally towards the West and that seems set to continue. Britain has been more vocal in recent weeks about the threat posed by Russia at a time when there is growing concern among some members of the ruling Conservative part",
            "Denmark will no longer automatically accept a quota of refugees under a U.N. resettlement program after passing a law on Wednesday that enables the government to determine how many can enter each year. Since 1989, Denmark has agreed to take 500 refugees a year selected by the United Nations under a program to ease the burden on countries that neighbor war zones. But after the European migration crisis in 2015 brought almost 20,000 claims for asylum, Denmark has refused to take any U.N. quota refugees. Under the new law, the immigration minister will decide how many refugees will be allowed under the U.N. program, with 500 now the maximum except in an exceptional situation . It's hard to predict how many refugees and migrants will show up at the border to seek asylum, and we know it may be hard to integrate those who arrive here, Immigration and Integration Minister Inger Stojberg said last month when her ministry proposed the law.

            "Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday likely gained ground ahead of national elections next year when the Court of Appeal ruled that the Election Commission can go ahead with a controversial redrawing of voting boundaries. Critics have called out the government over what they describe as skewing the borders in Najib's favour in the redelineation process as he seeks to win a third term in an election that must be held by August. The government denies the charge. Opponents of the redrawing process say it does not address an imbalanced distribution of voters, instead shoving opposition-inclined voters into opposition-held seats to create super-constituencies and also reshaping constituencies to have more distinct ethnic majorities. Electoral boundaries were last shifted nationwide in 2003, and even then the undefeated Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition was accused of manipulating the process. The commission is now seeking to redraw boundaries for more than",
            "Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski's political troubles will likely continue despite his surprise victory over a bid in Congress to oust him this week, a key opposition leader said on Saturday, citing ongoing graft probes and opposing demands from allies. Jose Chlimper, secretary general of the right-wing Popular Force, said his party could eventually emerge stronger from this week's political crisis, despite failing to garner enough votes in the 130-member Congress to remove Kuczynski from office. For us having 71 lawmakers was an asset but also a liability. Because whatever Congress did was our fault, Chlimper told Reuters in a rare interview. The party, which grew out of the populist movement of imprisoned ex-president Alberto Fujimori, sought to remove Kuczynski from office this week over business links he once denied having to a company at the center of a massive graft scandal. Ten Popular Force lawmakers broke ranks to keep a presidential vacancy moti",

Nigerian security forces were deployed to the border to stop any further crossings, said a military source. The Cameroonian and Nigerian governments said in separate statements there were no incursions. Relations between the two countries are good, Cameroon said. Cameroonian military officials and pro-government media accuse Nigeria of sheltering Anglophone insurgents.

I don t idolize nuclear energy at all. But I think you have to pick your battle. My priority in France, Europe and internationally is CO2 emissions and (global) warming, he told France 2 television in an interview. Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his election win in May, presided over a climate summit in Paris last week to breathe new life into a collective effort to fight climate change. But renewable energy only amounts to a tiny share of French electricity production, which is dominated by nuclear for 75 percent of it. Nuclear is not bad for carbon emissions, it's even the most carbon-free way to produce electricity with renewables, Macron said. The 39-year old, who has sought to forge strong ties wit",

Decisions such as these give hope that we can rebuild trust step by step and relax the bilateral relationship, Gabriel said in a statement released late on Thursday. Gabriel said he had agreed with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu to continue talks given the difficult issues that still had to be resolved.

The bill passed by the assembly is one of three that have triggered street protests across the country, a European Union state ranked as one of the bloc's most corrupt, and drawn opposition from thousands of magistrates. The three bills jointly limit magistrates independence and set up a special unit to probe crimes committed by magistrates. This makes magistrates the only professional category with a prosecuting unit dedicated to investigating them. The proposed changes mean the country is joining its eastern European peers Hungary and Poland, where populist leaders are also trying to control the judiciary, in defying EU concerns over the rule of law.

Coups in 1960 and 1980 and a failed 2016 putsch involved overt army use of force, but the resignation of prime minister Necmettin Erbakan followed warnings and only a brief appearance of tanks in a provincial town. It is an action that has long rankled with current Islamist-rooted President Tayyip Erdogan. In his final opinion on the case, the prosecutor said the army action, which did not result in any direct military rule, constituted a real coup attempt and could not be defined as post-modern , broadcaster NTV reported.

China's largely rubber stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, voted to allow Chinese immigration checks and the enforcement of mainland Chinese laws within part of the station, so that after boarding the train in Hong Kong passengers would not need to get off the train for immigration checks at the Hong Kong-mainland border.

But it seems that Rep. Al Green (D- TX) has had enough.On Wednesday afternoon Rep. Green took the floor of the House of Representatives and formally introduced Articles of Impeachment against Trump. Green began: I rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough.

Republicans were hoping for an 18 month increase and wanted to hold hurricane relief hostage in order to get concessions from the Democrats on other issues.But Trump pulled the rug out from under them because he knows that Republicans are incapable of governing even with majority control of the House and Senate.And that's why Trump kicked Republicans while they were down on Friday morning suggesting he took the Democrats offer because of Republican failures to pass legislation.

The state's argument was that the recent Wisconsin election results favoring Republicans is a reflection of Wisconsin's natural political geography with Democrats concentrated in urban areas such as Milwaukee and Madison.A panel of federal judges in Madison ruled 2-1 that the state's Republican-led redrawing of legislative districts amounted to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander violating the US Constitution's guarantees of equal",

Like the other comedians he has been very vocal about his feelings. For his part House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was not pleased with Meyers description of the legislation. Meyers said the newly passed American Health Care Act is a tax cut for the wealthy and that it will hurt the poorest and sickest among us.In order to make his views known Ryan had his staff send Meyers an email detailing all the ways he felt the comedian got it wrong. Not one to back down from a fight Meyers used his show's segment A Closer Look to respond.Meyers said to his audience: Unlike Republicans and their healthcare bill we actually read the whole email. This was clearly a jab at the many House members who did not take the time to read the bill they had passed.

The search warrant was wide-ranging and FBI agents working with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III departed the home with various records the Post writes. The raid came as Manafort has been voluntarily producing documents to congressional committees investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election. The search warrant indicates investigators may have argued to a federal judge they had reason to believe Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all records in response to a g",

Schlapp said in response: I get the fact that there's an opinion on Donald Trump that a lot of people don t like Donald Trump.

The 7th District was created in 1993 by decree of the Department of Justice who forced the state to create at least one majority minority district in order to comply with Section 5 of the Civil Rights Act. Much of the urban areas of Richmond were carved out into a new 3rd District and what was left the mainly white voters were left in the 7th.Being as Trump and Sessions are now the two most powerful racists in America it stands to reason that a guy representing an area that hasn t voted for a single Democrat in more than 45 years and never elected a person of color would want them to get along.In a statement released by Brat's office on Wednesday he decried the full-th",

In order to impress rivals males seeking to rise in the dominance hierarchy perform spectacular displays: stamping slapping the ground dragging branches throwing rocks. The more vigorous and imaginative the display the faster the individual is likely to rise in the hierarchy and the longer he is likely to maintain that position. And she was right.

With a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know Ryan claimed that the $2 059 more per year that families living paycheck-to-paycheck will see is extremely significant. Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600 000 per year (true) or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump's loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals",

The former reality show star and co-writer of Art of the Deal has unsurprisingly failed to make any deals after being on the job for 8 months now. Trump's approval ratings are abysmal as he finds himself to be the most unpopular president ever in the 70-year history of polling and then there are the investigations into his presidential campaign's possible ties to Russia.On top of that White House advisers have reportedly been warning Trump about his potential removal from office which entails the exhaustive impeachment process according to Newsweek.Meanwhile Trump is so worried that he's taken to his Twitter account to look for protection. It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President Trump tweeted in late July. If Republicans don t Repeal and Replace the",

Within 24 hours he was on Twitter having a spittle-laden meltdown over the negative coverage he's been receiving. Two articles one by the New York Times and the other by the Washington Post seem to have pushed him over the edge.First there was the New York Times which found a number of Senate Republicans willing to call him a moron:Senate Republican leadership has made it known that it would much rather negotiate with Mr. Pence than a president whose candidacy many did not even take seriously during the 2016 primaries. And some of the White House's efforts have clearly been counterproductive.Then there was the Washington Post which discovered that Trump had photoshopped a picture of himself onto the cover TIME magazine and hung it in his golf courses.The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least five of President Trump's clubs from South Flori",

When Trump was questioned about Russia by MSNBC White House Correspondent Hallie Jackson Trump betrayed America in front of the entire world.Jackson asked Trump Will you once and for all yes or no definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election? Trump responded by trashing U.S. intel and former President Barack Obama: I think it was Russia and I think it could have been a lot of people interfered. I said it very simply.

I need loyalty I expect loyalty Trump said in January according to Comey.Comey then gave details of a meeting he had with Trump in February after the firing of Mike Flynn for having discussions with Russian officials.The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn saying He is a good guy and has been through a lot. He repeated that Flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians but had misled the Vice President.

And he attacked. Then he attacked Afghanistan with the biggest bomb we have.Then he was lauded for both moves and also lauded for giving more control over this kind of thing to his generals. But Army vet Jason Kander speaking on CNN's State of the Union has hit the nail on the head for why Trump really gave that control to his generals: I believe he wants to take credit for good things when they happen and blame generals when bad things happen. Kander also explained that there were only two acceptable answers to why Trump would make such a move: He's the commander-in-chief and he also needs to defend the reasoning behind why a commander on t",

Under a fake pen name he regularly cites conspiracy theories and fake news stories from alt-right media reports including the ridiculous story that President Obama was born outside the U.S.During his confirmation hearing Bush attempted to downplay his destructive alt-right views as political activity. He openly made a pledge to separate his personal politics from his work as a judge on the courtroom bench.The confirmation hearing final vote came in with 51-47 without",

Huckabee Sanders points out that she is doing Spicer's job because he is on Naval Reserve duty. However in this episode he is outside in the bushes just as the real Sean Spicer did in a pathetic attempt to hide from reporters after the Comey news broke.

They don t? According to acting Assistant Attorney General Curtis Gannon they don t.

Economists expected 75 000 new jobs instead of a 33 000 job loss.The economy has added an average of 172 000 jobs a month over the past year but that has dropped to a 91 000 average over the past three months showing a trend which is not in Trump's favor.Axios reports:Economists widely blame the disruptive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey for the disappointing number because the survey methodology dictates that folks who didn t get paid on the pay period that included September 12th are not counted as employed.But the",

Seriously: Due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers we could not in good conscience take their money.

Of course Fox News is a private entity and is allowed to do this but the question remains: Is it censorship if they did so because of pressure from Trump?

Despite all of this it is important to note that the investigation does not put Kushner on the same level as people like fired campaign chair Paul Manafort and disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

Scarborough got divorced from his wife in 2013 and Brzezinki was officially free in 2016. To that end it seems that now that we are in 2017 a respectable enough amount of time has passed to where they can go ahead and confirm the public's belief that they were more than co-hosts.It is now being reported that the two are not only an item but are actually engaged to be married.

In fact McCain demanded that President (yes he called him President) Comey explain why he has decided that Hillary Clinton is innocent of colluding with Russia to sabotage her own campaign but the FBI insists on investigating Trump a double standard as McCain sees it.McCain who is apparently unable to wrap his head around the fact that an investigation into Hillary Clinton about something entirely separate had concluded while the investigation into Trump's collusion with the Kremlin is ongoing appeared to become confused during his questioning then things got crazy (crazier?).

He held out for less than three months.Trump's rediscovered love of censorship comes on the heels of several straight days of Trump freaking out about the New York Times reporting on his various scandals. And it's probably no coincidence that Trump is reconsidering press freedom right as his approval rating hits historic lows (the worst since Nixon was impeached and a record low for any president at this stage in office).In a culmination of Trump's rant against the New York Times he called for a change in libel laws and used an article written by the New York Post a right-leaning daily owned by Rupert Murdoch to pretend his troubles are due to the liberal media and not his own inco",

Rosenstein has already demanded the White House correct the record about this. As a consequence Trump himself told Lester Holt that the decision to fire Comey was all his. By all accounts Rosenstein is a man of integrity.

Instead they ll pocket the money they save in one of any number of ways and regular Americans won t benefit one iota from it.That's what they ll do with Trump's tax holiday.

But at a true press conference reporters are able to ask questions. Donald Trump wouldn t allow questions at this press conference. Acosta wanted to ask him about his responses to Charlottesville because Trump's initial response to it was weak and pathetic and one in which he wouldn t condemn the Nazis and other white supremacists and puffed himself up rather than saying something heartfelt and inspirational like a real president would have.Getting no answer to that Acosta asked him about the lack of a proper presser.

McCain then went on to rip the chaos of the Trump White House and particularly the effect their incompetence is having on national s",
            "Donald Trump has been fundraising like crazy for his re-election campaign having filed his papers the day he was inaugurated for his first term. But there's quite possibly an odd reason for his incessant begging for funds: According to Reuters he's using the money to pay for his defense team in the Russia scandal.Reuters spoke to two people who are familiar with the situation but they were unable to determine how much has already been spent on legal fees. Federal election laws allow candidates to spend private campaign donations on legal matters but up until now the legal matters in question dealt with routine and mundane things such as compliance requirements and ballot access issues.Trump may well become the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use his donations to pay for a criminal defense in addition to routine legal matters. One of the biggest reasons that candidates shifted largely from public financing to private financing for their election campaigns is",

Furthermore Putin said he would be willing to provide a copy to the U.S. Congress. The only catch is that the request would have to come from Trump himself.The Trump administration came under fire for holding a meeting with Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office last week a meeting that Russian media were able to attend yet from which U.S. media were banned. The situation came to a head when it became clear that Trump had disclosed confidential details pertaining to ISIS during the session. Initially the White House denied the scandal only to later claim that it was wholly appropriate for the president to discuss such information with the Russians.

We forget in the United States how long it has taken us to make We the People mean people like me. And indeed I do think that America was born with a birth defect; it was slavery.

That combined with poor understanding of marketing on new platforms has combined to really cause a struggle in the journalism industry.So on a certain level journalists can thank Trump. Despite unleashing a war on freedom of the press never before seen in our nation's history he's been a boon to business with massive public backlash against Trump and his fake news army resulting in a thirst for facts and information.Take the New York Times for example. In the first quarter of 2017 the NYT signed on more new subscribers than any other period in history. Stock is up 50 percent. Digital advertising revenue went up nearly 20 percent.

Ever since then everyone's been buzzing about just how dangerous Manafort can be to Trump now. However we also learned that another Trump associate by the name of George Papadopoulos had been arrested over the summer and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.And Papadopoulos may well be more important to this investigation than Manafort despite the fact that he isn t that well known. Why? Because contrary to what Sarah H. Sanders tries telling the media he was a foreign policy adviser on Trump's campaign who did in fact try colluding with the Russians. And it's his testimony and documents that could bring Trump's presidency crashing down around him.One official connected to the campaign and who reportedly witnessed Papadopoulos efforts to get Trump to meet with Russian officials says that Trump",

There's nothing been revealed to suggest the Obama administration surveilled the Trump campaign. That's not even what Nunes is saying. He's saying there's incidental collection outside of Russia.The problem he's created is he's gone out on a lark by himself sort of an Inspector Clouseau investigation here trying to find some unmasking information about collection incidental with the Trump campaign and some foreign agent outside of Russia.

Conway said: I went back and looked at exactly what was being discussed on all the TV shows except yours at 7:09 a.m. on Wednesday when this happened and it's a really curious exercise because as Steve Scalise was fighting for his life and crawling into right field in a trail of blood you",

However it's also worth noting that the very same Republicans now suggesting liberals are inciting violence don t seem to have the same concerns about their own side.The calls to cool down partisan rhetoric ironic as it may be seem to be entirely partisan. One side and it rhymes with treepublicans aren t pulling their weight. The story unfolds each time this happens like clockwork: Liberals join with conservatives in condemning hate on both sides. Conservatives fall silent when right-wing extremists go on violent rampages repeatedly failing to police their own.A prime example of this disconnect is Sen. Rand Paul.

To add insult to injury these latest numbers bring the overall satisfaction rating among Americans to a paltry 24% the lowest since July 2016 which came on the heels of a spree of killings of African-American men at the hands of police officers and then a spate of shootings of law enforcement officers pushing the country to the brink.

That's no small wonder: Insurance companies gave Republican candidates and conservative groups nearly 37 million dollars in the last election cycle of 2015-16 alone.But the one thing Obamacare didn t do couldn t do was clamp down on premiums. Not without changing the way the entire industry is regulated. The fact is premiums have been skyrocketing for a long time and for a simple reason.

            "There's a lot of talk that if Mueller indicts friends and associates of Trump over the Russia scandal Trump will just pardon them and nobody will get punished least of all Trump. There are two problems with that: First to accept a pardon is to admit guilt so he d be throwing them under the bus. But secondly and perhaps more importantly any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner. According to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) his pardoning power is not exactly absolute.Schiff told ABC News: I don t think the president's power is all that absolute as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it's an effort to obstruct justice if it's an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the President's own conduct. So there are limitations. This whole thing really took off when Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey.

Sounding like a Republican who might actually have a tiny grip on reality Sanford argued that Trump helped create a toxic political environment which may have motivated yesterday's attack. Sanford said: I think we have to watch out as a society because if we don t watch out civility is indeed a part of civilized government and an open political system. If you let these forces play out I think we end up at a very very bad spot. I think what happened yesterday was symptomatic of it.

The variation in percentage differs state-by-state depending on whether the state accepts regulatory waivers under the American Health Care Act which would allow insurers to offer much skimpier health plans at lower premiums. What this means is that states that allow the waivers would have far lower premiums but the individual would be covered for a lot less as well whereas states that don t have the waivers would have a higher rate but more comprehensive coverage.Premiums would also differ grea",
