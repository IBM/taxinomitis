            "TEXT1": "In this project, students trained a machine learning model to recognise the first bit of the postcode for a few local cities. (<em>For non-UK readers, this is equivalent to something like a zip-code or perhaps the two-letter abbreviation for a name of a state or county</em>).",
            "TEXT2": "They did this by drawing examples of how those postal codes are written, directly onto an on-screen canvas.",
            "TEXT3": "They used this to make a game in Scratch based on the children's television show <em>Postman Pat</em>, where they would write a postcode onto an on-screen envelope, and their machine learning model would recognise what they had written and move the envelope to the correct <em>Postman Pat</em> van.",
            "TEXT4": "My goal for the project was to introduce them to the idea of using machine learning for handwriting recognition, and optical character recognition in general. Instead of just telling them that this tech exists, they learned about it through playing and experimenting with a simplified version that created themselves. Although their own models could only recognise a few letters, this was still enough to help them understand what was possible.",
            "TEXT5": "While they were interested in the technology, what seemed to have the biggest impact on the students was the idea that artificial intelligence is used when they post a letter. This was something that they hadn't thought of before. It opened up their eyes to the idea that AI systems are all around us. They started asking questions about where else machine learning models are used.",
            "TEXT6": "The takeaway for the lesson was that it got them thinking about how they interact with artificial intelligence systems every day, even when they don't directly see it.",
            "CALLOUT": "Creating projects based on real-world applications of machine learning is an effective way to open up students' eyes to the fact that AI systems are all around them, and impact their lives in countless unseen ways."
